# ChatGPT-Based Tool for Visualization Design

The tool uses OpenAI's ChatGPT API to interpret the user's input and generate a suitable p5.js code and image or visualization based on the user's input. The tool also includes an error page to notify users in case their input is invalid or not interpretable by the ChatGPT API.
